/**
 * Flex Jobs class
 *
 * Flex jobs supports Python and Scala language.
 * The flexible execution class is appropriate for non-urgent jobs such as
 * pre-production jobs, testing, and one-time data loads.
 * Flexible job runs are supported for jobs using AWS Glue version 3.0 or later and G.1X or
 * G.2X worker types but will default to the latest version of Glue (currently Glue 3.0.)
 *
 * Similar to ETL, we’ll enable these features: —enable-metrics, —enable-spark-ui,
 * —enable-continuous-cloudwatch-log
 *
